# Introduction

 This README describes all the steps needed to run the simple Aquaponics setup up and running for the School Project. This repository contains all the schematics and software needed to run everything, as well as a complete list of hardware resources needed with possible sources to provide them.


# Software needed

* Any operating system will do (Windows, GNU/Linux, Mac). 
* The hardware schematics have been created using __[Fritzing](http://fritzing.org)__ (FOSS).
* The software can be compiled and sent on the Arduino using the __[Arduino SDK](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)__ (FOSS). 


# Hardware materials needed

To have a complete system, a minimal set of hardware is required. It is also possible to _upgrade_ the system to give it more capabilities later on.

All prices are including BTW

## Required hardware

### Electronics

* **Arduino**
 * An [Arduino Leonardo](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardLeonardo) will be used
 * Possible source - [Kiwi electronics](https://www.kiwi-electronics.nl/arduino-leonardo-met-headers-ATmega32u4?search=leonardo) - 21.95€

* **Cables BreadBoard Fem/Fem**
 * Used for connecting the board to the components
 * Possible source - [Amazon](http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00ENSOHJ0?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_act_title_2&smid=A1P3HNFSEHPC4K) - 1.49€

* **Cables BreadBoard Mal/Fem**
 * Used for connecting the board to the components
 * Possible source - [Amazon](http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00ENSOGWS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_act_title_1&smid=A1P3HNFSEHPC4K) - 1.49€

* **Relay Board**
 * 4 relays board, to power the two pumps as well as the led strips. 5V trigger is low enough to use the Arduino.
 * Possible source - [Amazon](http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00AZEVSQG?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_act_title_3&smid=A3BIDE681BQEK5) - 3.03€

* **Water sensor**
 * Chosen device is a simple switch activated using the same principle as toilet flushes. 
 * Possible source - [Amazon](http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B009DYP2H0?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_act_title_1&smid=AGJ2TI2R2YFK8) - 2.01€

* **Pump**
 * 12V pumps have proven to be powerful enough. Since we do not use a Bell Siphon system, we will need 2 pumps.
 * Possible source - [Amazon](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00OIHLTME?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00) - 7.59€ * 2 = 15.18€
 * A cheaper version - [Amazon](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B008OPKSC8?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00) - 3.93€ * 2 = 7.86€

### General purpose, Consumables

On top of the purely electronic components, a number of additional elements are required to have a complete Aquaponics system runnning.

Plastic buckets
Plastic pipe for pumps
Fishes
Fish food
Ph strips
Cable for the Arduino
cable as well for arduino
Actual plants
ceramic balls

## Possible upgrades

Those elements are not required for the basic system, but can be used to improve the automation and or go further in the project.

* **LED Strip**
 * The LED Strip is used to improve the growth rate of plants. It uses special wavelength. 2m is enough for one system, and the strip can be cut as desired. We use 12V strips to match the pumps voltage
 * Natural light can be enough but for winter times, it is advised to use grow lights as it allows to control the day/night cycles.

* **Ultra Sound Sensor**
 * The Ultra Sound sensor can be used as a replacement for the water level sensor. It allows for a more precise control of the water level, and is also less subject for mechanical failures. 
 * Possible source - [Amazon](http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00BIZQWYE?dpID=41dsw83-RXL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_SL500_SR135%2C135_&refRID=50345E784KBQDMPTW3C2&ref_=pd_rhf_sc_s_cp_5) - 1.46€

## Total Prices

This part simply aims at summarizing the numbers listed above to give an idea of the price of a simple system, as well as an upgraded system.

Those prices do not include shipping costs, which will vary depending on the number of systems to build.

* Simple system, no upgrade included : (per system)
* Fully upgraded system : (per system)
